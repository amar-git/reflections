# Reflections from lesson 2

Q.	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A.	First of all to initialize the git repository we run a command git init in
	concerned directory. When we initialize the repository it creates a hidden
	directory .git in the parent directory. This .git hidden folder or
	directory is used to store the various verions or commits that a user make.
	After its initialization we can run a command git status to see the current
	status of the repository. It actually contains nothing, i.e. the number of
	commits is zero and shows that it has n number of untracked files. We need
	to do this in order to be able to store various versions or commits of the
	file whenever required.

Q.	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
	repository? What value do you think it offers?
A.	Staging area holds temporarily all the files that one might be interested
	in clubbing for a single commit. Is gives the choice of putting files
	together with a single logical change. Staging area lies in between the
	working directory and the repository. Once we are sure enough to commit,
	we can move all the file in the staging area to the repository and add a
	related commit message.
	Staging are offers a great way to organise files and apply judgemenal call
	that is required in order to make version control efficient and succint.
