Q.  When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A.  There are many benefits of creating remote repository rather than keeping all the work
    local. First of all we can access it from any computer, rather than worring about keeping
    the work in a thumbdrive or so. Anyone who's working on the project can access the repository
    remotely and contribute the changes to it. If we're working locally, even then it's very easy
    to push the changes with recent commits to the remote repository.
